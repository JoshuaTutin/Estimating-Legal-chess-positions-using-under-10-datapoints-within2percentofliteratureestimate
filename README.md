Tablebase data shows number of legal known chess positions for up to 7 pieces (with an estimate for 8 pieces also). I tried extrapolating the data to estimate the total number of legal chess positions and got a value within the correct order of magnitude. Maybe with more data points added if tablebase increases, this could improve literature estimates.
