Tablebase data shows number of legal known chess positions for up to 7 pieces (with an estimate for 8 pieces also). I tried extrapolating the data to estimate the total number of legal chess positions and got a value within 2% of the literature value. Maybe with more data points added if tablebase increases, this could improve literature estimates.

Despite using a smaller number of datapoints, the estimated value ended up being about 4.726e44 which is within about 2% of the value estimated by literature of 4.822e44.
